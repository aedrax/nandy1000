The name is an homage to the Tandy 1000 but unrelated otherwise.

The goal of this project is to make a fully functioning computer starting with only the NAND gate. I will be using Verilog for the HDL but will avoid using any verilog features (like operators and `always` blocks). I will use the `nand` built-in and build modules on top of that. This computer is based ont he information found in the book [The Elements of Computing Systems](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/elements-computing-systems) by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.
